## 正文

" It comes down to this," said Hermione, rubbing her forehead. "Either Mr. Crouch attacked Viktor, or somebody else attacked both of them when Viktor wasn’t looking."

"It must’ve been Crouch," said Ron at once. "That’s why he was gone when Harry and Dumbledore got there. He’d done a runner."

"I don’t think so," said Harry, shaking his head. "He seemed really weak - I don’t reckon he was up to Disapparating or anything."

"You cant Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds, haven’t I told you enough times?" said Hermione.

"Okay. . . hows this for a theory," said Ron excitedly. "Krum attacked Crouch - no, wait for it - and then Stunned himself!"

"And Mr. Crouch evaporated, did he?" said Hermione coldly.

"Oh yeah . . ."

It was daybreak. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had crept out of their dormitories very early and hurried up to the Owlery together to send a note to Sirius. Now they were standing looking out at the misty grounds. All three of them were puffy-eyed and pale because they had been talking late into the night about Mr. Crouch.

“照这样说，”赫敏揉着额头说，“不是克劳奇袭击了威克多尔，就是什么趁威克多尔不注意时袭击了他们俩。”

“肯定是克劳奇，”罗恩马上说，“所以哈利和邓布利多赶到那儿时他已经不见了。溜得够快的。”

“我想不会，”哈利摇了摇头说，“他看上去很虚弱——我不认为他能幻影移形什么的。”

“你不可能在霍格沃茨地场地上幻影移形，我跟你讲过多少遍了?”赫敏说道。

“哎……会不会是这样，”罗恩兴奋地说道，“克鲁姆袭击了克劳奇——嗯——然后给他自己念了个昏迷咒!”

“然后克劳奇先生变成蒸气挥发了，是不是?”赫敏冷冷地说。

“啊，这个……”

天刚放亮，哈利、罗恩和赫敏一大早就溜出宿舍，急忙跑到猫头鹰棚屋给小天狼星发信。现在他们站在那里眺望着雾蒙蒙的场地，三个人都眼皮浮肿，脸色苍白，因为他们昨天夜里为克劳奇先生的事讨论到很晚。
