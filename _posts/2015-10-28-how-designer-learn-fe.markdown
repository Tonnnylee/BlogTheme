The Hogwarts grounds never looked more inviting than when Harry had to stay indoors. For the next few days he spent all of his free time either in the library with Hermione and Ron, looking up hexes, or else in empty classrooms, which they sneaked into to practice. Harry was concentrating on the Stunning Spell, which he had never used before. The trouble was that practicing it involved certain sacrifices on Ron’s and Hermione’s part.

"Can’t we kidnap Mrs. Norris？" Ron suggested on Monday lunchtime as he lay flat on his back in the middle of their Charms classroom, having just been Stunned and reawoken by Harry for the fifth time in a row. "Let’s Stun her for a bit. Or you could use Dobby, Harry, I bet he’d do anything to help you. I’m not complaining or anything" - he got gingerly to his feet, rubbing his backside - "but I’m aching all over. ..."

"Well, you keep missing the cushions, don’t you！" said Hermione impatiently, rearranging the pile of cushions they had used for the Banishing Spell, which Flitwick had left in a cabinet. "Just try and fall backward！"

"Once you’re Stunned, you can’t aim too well, Hermione！ "said Ron angrily. "Why don’t you take a turn？"

"Well, I think Harry’s got it now, anyway," said Hermione hastily. "And we don’t have to worry about Disarming, because he’s been able to do that for ages. ... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening."

She looked down the list they had made in the library.

哈利被迫待在房间里之后，觉得霍格沃茨的场地从来没有这样诱人。后来几天他不是跟赫敏和罗恩在图书馆查找毒咒，就是和他们偷偷溜进没人的空教室里练习。哈利专心练习昏迷咒，他以前从未使用过这种咒语。就是罗恩和赫敏要做出一些牺牲了。

“我们能不能绑架洛丽丝夫人？”星期一中午罗恩提议道。他躺在魔咒课教室里的地板上，刚才连续五次被哈利击昏又弄醒。“用它来练习练习。或者用多比，哈利，我打赌他为了你什么都肯做的。我不是抱怨，”——他小心翼翼地站起来，揉着后背——“可我浑身都疼……”

“你老是不摔在垫子上！”赫敏不耐烦地说，一面整理着他们练驱逐咒时用过的那堆垫子，弗立维把它们留在了柜子里。“你要往后摔！”

“被击昏后不可能瞄得那么准，赫敏！”罗恩生气地说，“你为什么自己不试试？”

“哦，我想哈利已经掌握了，”赫敏忙说，“檄械咒用不着担心，他早就会用了……我想今晚我们应该练几个毒咒。”

她低头看着他们在图书馆开的单子。
